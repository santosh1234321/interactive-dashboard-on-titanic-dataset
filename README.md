# Titanic Interactive Dashboard
This project is an interactive data analysis dashboard built in Python that explores the famous Titanic dataset using Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and IPyWidgets. Users can dynamically filter passengers by age range and visualize survival statistics, gender-based outcomes, class effects, and age distributions with informative charts. The dashboard computes summary metrics for the filtered subset, such as survival rates by gender, average age, passenger class counts, and the most common survivor age, and updates all graphs in real time with user selections.

## Features:
- Interactive age range filtering via a slider widget
- Automatic summary statistics for the selected passenger group
- Pie, bar, stacked histogram, and boxplot visualizations for survival and demographic analysis
- Dynamic dashboard powered by Matplotlib, Seaborn, and IPyWidgets
- Fast data cleaning and missing value handling for robust analysis

## Technologies Used:
Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, IPyWidgets, Jupyter Notebook

## Usage:
Open the notebook and run all cells. Use the age slider widget to explore how survival patterns change across different age groups, genders, and passenger classes. Insights update automatically with every selection.

## Ideal For:
- Data science students, machine learning learners, and those interested in interactive statistical visualizations or the Titanic dataset.
